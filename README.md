# This is a ASIC project of implemention of AES

## The AES cipher core is fork from others, the information contained at the begin of the fiel.

## The testbench is tiny, only to show it is functional.

## The model also from others and the way to use it is just edit the tester.py

## The UVM is added, because I found the systemverilog dpi can help me build a reliable reference model, so i can implement the UVM, and check more spec about the design. Of course it is on building!
